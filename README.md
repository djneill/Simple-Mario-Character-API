# Simple-Mario-Character-API

Take a look at it here ðŸ‘‰ https://odd-colt-vestments.cyclic.app/

There is not any front end design on this, it's a simple api that returns a json object with character stats. Mario's object does also have an image. I will add a designed client side front end at a later date.
